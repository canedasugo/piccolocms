# PiccoloCMS

Piccolo CMS is a very very truly tiny flat-file CMS, born out of my need to put up minimal websites with a very simple structure.
I also needed to have something easy to template, and that other people could approach and edit.

I used to use WordPress in those cases, but then the last time I had to explain a childhood friend how to use it, I found it just too confusing for a beginner.

Hence Piccolo CMS!
